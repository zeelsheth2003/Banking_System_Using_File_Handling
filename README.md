# Banking_System_Using_File_Handling
A program using C language on the topic File Handling, Structure and Union.
 <br />Approach:
 Letâ€™s discuss the approach in detail, covering all the functions and their explanation in detail-
Create a Menu in the main function and create different functions for the Menu, which will be called using switch case statements. There are four different functions-
<ol type="1">
 <li>account()- This function is used to create a new account.</li>
<li>transfermoney()- This function is used to transfer money to the account</li>
<li>checkbalance()- This function is used to check the balance in the account.</li>
<li>login()- This function is used to login into the account.</li>
 </ol>
<ul>
 <li>First, create an account of our user by calling the account() function after the creation of an account, store all the data into a file using file handling functions.</li>
<li>Then the user is able to transfer the amount to other users, for that transfermoney() function is called, and for checking the current balance in the account call checkbalance() function.</li>
<li>Concepts of file handling will be used to store the data of the users, and then read all data from that particular file, store structures in a file because they are easy to write and read.</li>
